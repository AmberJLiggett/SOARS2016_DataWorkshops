# WORKSHOP 1

## Tools
In this workshop we're going to learn a little about the tools and language we'll repeatedly access through the summer.  First on to the tool chain we're going to work with :

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
|Python|This is the language we'll be using this summer.  Let's make sure it is installed and ready to use.  If you went through the [installation](../README.md) tutorial, you should be good to go. |
|PyCharm|This is our editor (one of many you could use).  It is full functioning and pretty friendly once you get the hang of its functions.  PyCharm is excellent for writing longer, more complex code in a project-like environment.  Let's see that everything is OK with the [installation of PyCharm](../README.md). |
|Github|[Github](https://github.com) is an excellent place to share, find and contribute to open source projects of all kinds.  There are millions of repositories representing everything from scientific projects to programming langages, web servers and websites.  You can get lost on there! |
|Jupyter Notebooks|We'll affectionately use NB as a shorthand for Jupyter Notebooks, but this tool is the backbone of data exploration in Python these days.  With support for so many interesting things, you'll soon find out that you can do a lot of great things and share them with others when you're done. Support for NB is OK in PyCharm, but we'll play mostly with it directy in the browser on the server that we'll invoke from within PyCharm.|

## The Python Language
Python is the language of choice these days for many of the data science and analytics tasks we're faced with on a day-to-day basis.  There is a basic assumption that you have had _some_ exposure to at least _one_ programming language, but if you need to brush up on some basic concepts, check out the [resources page](../resources.md) for more places to learn about Python.

To get started, let's review the [Python Primer](primer_python.md) that will go over the **very basics** of the language and get your feet we in what it is all about and what it can do.

## A Primer on Text-based Data Files

For starters, many of the files you'll be working with through the summer (and beyond) are in some text format or another.  The most popular (generally) being CSV or TSV (comma separated, tab separated, respectively).  Netcdf is very common binary format used in the Geosciences, and we'll touch in on them if we have time.  Python makes doing basic operations on text files very straightforward, hence its use as a language of choice text processing language.

We'll get started with a review and shallow dive [into processing text files in Python](primer_files.md).
